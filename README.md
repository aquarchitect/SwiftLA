SwiftLA
=======

LearnSwiftLA is a weekly meet-up that meets every other week at [OPODZ](http://www.opodz.com) - an awesome co-working space in Little Tokyo, and alternate weeks at other venues in Los Angeles.

Each meet-up contains 2 Live Coding sessions: 
- **First half**: about Swift syntax, in which participants solve a series of problems from [Exercism](http://exercism.io) - a code mentoring platform.
- **Second half**: learning a different members-suggested framework from native to third-party.

The meet-up format uses the Pair Programming methodology with a *twist*. Instead of pairing up, there will be a dedicated driver typing the code, and the rest will contribute to problem solving and code implementation.

If you live in the LA area, check us out at [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/start-la/events/229333148/).

> While the experimental format is being tested for the first night on March 23, 2016, it creates an amazing engaging atmosphere for members, who are new to Swift. 
> They have a chance to explore all of the different implementation's possibilities with Swift and gain a deep understanding of how the language works.
