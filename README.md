SwiftLA
=======

LearnSwiftLA is a weekly meet-up that meets every other week at [OPODZ](http://www.opodz.com) - an awesome co-working space in Little Tokyo, and alternate weeks at other venues in Los Angeles.

Each meet-up contains 2 Live Coding sessions: 
- The first half is about Swift syntax in which participants solve a series of problems from [Exercism](http://exercism.io) - code mentoring platform.
- The second half is to learn about a variety of member-suggested frameworks from native to third-party.

The meet-up uses the Pair Programming methodology with a *twist*. Instead of pairing up, there will be a dedicated driver typing the code, and the rest will contribute to problem solving and code implementation.
