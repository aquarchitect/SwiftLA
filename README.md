SwiftLA
=======

LearnSwiftLA is a weekly meet-up that meets every other week at [OPODZ](http://www.opodz.com) - an awesome co-working space in Little Tokyo, and alternate weeks at other venues in Los Angeles.

Each meet-up contains 2 Live Coding sessions: 
- **First half**: about Swift syntax, in which participants solve a series of problems from [Exercism](http://exercism.io) - a code mentoring platform.
- **Second half**: learning a different members-suggested framework from native to third-party.

We experimented with the new format for the first time on March 23, 2016 and found that it creates an engaging learning atmosphere for both Swift novices and veterans alike.

The meet-up format uses the Pair Programming methodology with a *twist*. Instead of pairing up, a dedicated driver types the code while participants contribute to problem solving and code implementation.
